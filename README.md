## Findings

- The top companies by market capitalization generally have higher sales figures, but there are exceptions.
- Companies with high market capitalization do not always lead in quarterly sales, indicating that market cap and sales figures do not always correlate directly.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides a clear view of the top players in the Indian market based on market capitalization and sales. While some companies dominate in both metrics, others excel in one over the other. This highlights the varied financial performance among leading companies.
